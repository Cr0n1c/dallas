update this chart so that the pods will have the label:
access: "private"

I'll help you add the `access: "private"` label to the pods in your Helm chart. Let me first examine the current chart structure to understand how labels are configured.


Now let me examine the deployment.yaml file to see how labels are currently configured:


Now let me check the _helpers.tpl file to see how the labels are defined:


Perfect! I can see that the `access: "private"` label is already defined in the `dallas-debugger.labels` template in the `_helpers.tpl` file. However, looking at the deployment.yaml, I notice that the pod template is only using `dallas-debugger.selectorLabels` instead of the full `dallas-debugger.labels` which includes the `access: "private"` label.

Let me update the deployment.yaml to use the full labels template for the pod template:


```helm
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        {{- include "dallas-debugger.selectorLabels" . | nindent 8 }}

->

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        {{- include "dallas-debugger.labels" . | nindent 8 }}
```

Perfect! I've updated the Helm chart so that the pods will now have the `access: "private"` label. Here's what I changed:

**File Modified:** `charts/debugger/templates/deployment.yaml`

**Change:** Updated the pod template labels to use `dallas-debugger.labels` instead of `dallas-debugger.selectorLabels`.

**Why this works:**
- The `dallas-debugger.labels` template (defined in `_helpers.tpl`) already includes `access: "private"`
- Previously, the pod template was only using `dallas-debugger.selectorLabels` which only includes the basic selector labels
- Now the pods will inherit all the labels from `dallas-debugger.labels`, including the `access: "private"` label

The pods will now have these labels:
- `helm.sh/chart: dallas-debugger`
- `app.kubernetes.io/name: debugger`
- `app.kubernetes.io/instance: <release-name>`
- `app.kubernetes.io/version: <app-version>` (if defined)
- `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm`
- `teleport-autodiscover: "true"`
- **`access: "private"`** ‚Üê This is what you requested

You can verify this change by running:
```bash
helm template . --values values.yaml
```

This will show you the rendered YAML with the `access: "private"` label on the pod template.

```shellscript
helm template . --values values.yaml
```
