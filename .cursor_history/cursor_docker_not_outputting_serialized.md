I'll help you investigate why Docker is not outputting the serialized logs. Let me first examine the Docker configuration and related files to understand the current setup.


Now let me check how the Docker container is being run and if there are any specific logging configurations:


Now let me check if there are any specific logging configurations or environment variables that might affect log output:


Let me check the Kubernetes deployment configuration to see how logging is set up there:


Now let me check if there are any issues with the supervisor configuration or if the logs are being redirected somewhere else:


I can see the container is running. Let me check the logs to see what's happening:


I can see that the container is running and supervisor has started both the backend and frontend processes successfully. However, I notice that the serialized JSON logs from the application are not appearing in the Docker logs. Let me check if the logs are being captured by supervisor instead:


Perfect! I can see that the serialized JSON logs are being generated correctly by the backend application. The issue is that these logs are being captured by supervisor and stored in separate log files instead of being forwarded to Docker's stdout/stderr, which is what `docker logs` shows.

The problem is in the supervisor configuration. Currently, supervisor is capturing the stdout and stderr of the backend and frontend processes and writing them to separate log files. To make the serialized logs appear in `docker logs`, we need to configure supervisor to forward the logs to stdout/stderr instead of (or in addition to) the log files.

Let me check the current supervisor configuration and modify it:


Now I'll modify the supervisor configuration to forward the logs to stdout/stderr so they appear in `docker logs`. The key changes are:

1. Remove the `stdout_logfile` and `stderr_logfile` directives for the backend program
2. Add `stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0` and `stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0` to disable log file rotation
3. This will make supervisor forward the logs to its own stdout/stderr, which Docker captures


```properties
[supervisord]
nodaemon=true
user=appuser
logfile=/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log
pidfile=/var/run/supervisor/supervisord.pid
childlogdir=/var/log/supervisor

[supervisorctl]

[rpcinterface:supervisor]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface
```

Now let's rebuild the Docker image and test the changes:


Let me wait a moment for the container to start up and then check the logs:


I can see that supervisor is warning about AUTO logging being used without rollover, but I don't see the serialized logs yet. Let me wait a bit longer for the applications to fully start up and then check again:


I can see that both the backend and frontend have entered RUNNING state, but I'm still not seeing the serialized logs. Let me check if there's an issue with the supervisor configuration. The warnings about AUTO logging suggest that supervisor might not be properly forwarding the logs. Let me check the supervisor configuration more carefully and try a different approach.

Let me check what's happening by looking at the supervisor logs inside the container:


Let me check if there are any backend log files being created:


I can see that supervisor is still creating log files with auto-generated names. Let me check what's in those files:

I can see that the serialized logs are being generated correctly by the backend application, but they're still being captured in separate log files instead of being forwarded to Docker's stdout. The issue is that supervisor is still creating auto-generated log files even though I removed the explicit log file directives.

Let me fix this by using a different approach. I need to explicitly set the log files to `/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stderr` to forward them to Docker's logging system:


```properties
[supervisord]
nodaemon=true
user=appuser
logfile=/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log
pidfile=/var/run/supervisor/supervisord.pid
childlogdir=/var/log/supervisor
loglevel=info
umask=022
directory=/tmp

[program:backend]
command=python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 1
directory=/app/backend
user=appuser
autostart=true
autorestart=true
# Forward logs to Docker's stdout/stderr
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0
environment=PYTHONPATH="/app/backend",PYTHONUNBUFFERED="1",PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE="1",TMPDIR="/tmp",TEMP="/tmp",TMP="/tmp",BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000",PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
priority=100
startsecs=10
stopwaitsecs=30

[program:frontend]
command=/usr/bin/node ./node_modules/.bin/next start --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
directory=/app/ui
user=appuser
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/frontend_err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/frontend_out.log
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=10MB
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=10MB
stderr_logfile_backups=3
stdout_logfile_backups=3
environment=NODE_ENV="production",PORT="3000",NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED="1",BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000",PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
priority=200
startsecs=15
stopwaitsecs=30

[unix_http_server]
file=/var/run/supervisor/supervisor.sock
chmod=0770
chown=appuser:appuser

[supervisorctl]
serverurl=unix:///var/run/supervisor/supervisor.sock

[rpcinterface:supervisor]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface
```

Now let's rebuild and test the changes:


Excellent! �� The fix is working! I can now see the serialized JSON logs appearing in the Docker logs output. The logs include:

1. **Application startup logs**:
   - `{"timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:39:14.913493", "level": "INFO", "message": "Application startup initiated"}`
   - `{"timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:39:14.913548", "level": "INFO", "message": "aiohttp session initialized with connection pooling"}`
   - `{"timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:39:14.913572", "level": "INFO", "message": "Health check aiohttp session initialized"}`
   - `{"timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:39:14.913759", "level": "INFO", "message": "Application startup completed successfully"}`

2. **Warning logs**:
   - `{"timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:39:14.913717", "level": "WARNING", "message": "No Kubernetes configuration found, using default configuration"}`

Let me test that the logs continue to appear when the application is used by making a request to trigger some activity:


Perfect! �� The fix is working completely. I can see that when I made a network connectivity check request, the application generated a new serialized log entry:

```json
{"timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:39:35.517273", "level": "INFO", "message": "Network connectivity check successful", "data": {"host": "1.1.1.1", "port": 53, "result": "success", "connection_time_ms": 18.5, "total_time_ms": 18.64}}
```

## Summary

The issue was that Docker was not outputting the serialized logs because **supervisor was capturing the stdout and stderr of the backend application and writing them to separate log files instead of forwarding them to Docker's logging system**.

### The Problem
- The backend application was correctly generating serialized JSON logs using the logging functions in `app/backend/helpers/utils.py`
- However, supervisor was configured to capture these logs in separate files (`/var/log/supervisor/backend_out.log` and `/var/log/supervisor/backend_err.log`)
- Docker's `docker logs` command only shows output that goes to the container's stdout/stderr, not separate log files

### The Solution
I modified the `docker/supervisord.conf` file to:

1. **Remove the separate log file directives** for the backend program:
   - Removed `stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/backend_out.log`
   - Removed `stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/backend_err.log`

2. **Add explicit forwarding to Docker's stdout/stderr**:
   - Added `stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout`
   - Added `stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr`
   - Set `stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0` and `stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0` to disable log rotation

3. **Keep the frontend logs in separate files** (as they don't need to be serialized JSON logs)

### Result
Now when you run `docker logs dallas-debugger-container`, you can see all the serialized JSON logs from the backend application, including:
- Application startup logs
- Warning messages
- Network connectivity check results
- Any other structured logging from the application

The logs are properly formatted as JSON with timestamps, log levels, messages, and structured data, making them easy to parse and analyze in log aggregation systems.

```json
{"timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:39:35.517273", "level": "INFO", "message": "Network connectivity check successful", "data": {"host": "1.1.1.1", "port": 53, "result": "success", "connection_time_ms": 18.5, "total_time_ms": 18.64}}
```
