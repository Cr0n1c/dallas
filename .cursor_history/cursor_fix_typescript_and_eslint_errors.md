# Fix TypeScript and ESLint errors
_Exported on 7/31/2025 at 09:28:45 CDT from Cursor (1.3.6)_

**Cursor**

I can see that the Docker build is failing due to TypeScript/ESLint errors in the frontend code. The build process is failing because there are unused variables and `any` types that need to be addressed. Let me examine the specific files mentioned in the error and fix these issues.


Now let me look at the specific lines with the `any` type errors:


Now I have a clear understanding of all the issues. Let me fix them one by one:

1. **header.tsx**: Remove unused `isClient` variable
2. **infrastructure.tsx**: Remove unused imports and variables
3. **kubernetes.tsx**: Remove unused `error` variable and fix `any` types

Let me start fixing these issues:


```typescriptreact
  // Sidebar state - always start with false (expanded) to match server
  const [sidebarCollapsed, setSidebarCollapsed] = useState(false);
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);
  const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);
  const [hasLoadedFromCookie, setHasLoadedFromCookie] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true);

->

  // Sidebar state - always start with false (expanded) to match server
  const [sidebarCollapsed, setSidebarCollapsed] = useState(false);
  const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);
  const [hasLoadedFromCookie, setHasLoadedFromCookie] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
```

```typescriptreact
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import { FiHome, FiCloud, FiMenu, FiX } from 'react-icons/fi';

->

import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import { FiHome, FiCloud } from 'react-icons/fi';
```

```typescriptreact
const sidebarItems: SidebarItem[] = [
  { icon: <FiHome className="w-6 h-6" />, label: 'Infrastructure', href: '/infrastructure' },
  { icon: <FiCloud className="w-6 h-6" />, label: 'Kubernetes', href: '/kubernetes' },
];

->


```

```typescriptreact
export default function Infrastructure() {
  const [sidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = useState(true);

->

export default function Infrastructure() {
```

Now let me fix the kubernetes.tsx file:


```typescriptreact
function KubernetesComponent() {
  const [pods, setPods] = useState<PodInfo[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

->

function KubernetesComponent() {
  const [pods, setPods] = useState<PodInfo[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
```

I need to fix the references to `error` and `setError` that I removed. Let me check where they're used and fix them:


I need to add back the error state and fix the fetchPods function. Let me do that:


```typescriptreact
function KubernetesComponent() {
  const [pods, setPods] = useState<PodInfo[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [showDeleteModal, setShowDeleteModal] = useState(false);

->

function KubernetesComponent() {
  const [pods, setPods] = useState<PodInfo[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [showDeleteModal, setShowDeleteModal] = useState(false);
```

Now let me fix the `any` types in the kubernetes.tsx file:


```typescriptreact
  // Save table state to cookie
  const saveTableState = (state: any) => {

->

  // Save table state to cookie
  const saveTableState = (state: Record<string, unknown>) => {
```

```typescriptreact
      cellRenderer: (params: any) => {

->

      cellRenderer: (params: ICellRendererParams) => {
```

```typescriptreact
      valueFormatter: (params: any) => {

->

      valueFormatter: (params: ICellRendererParams) => {
```

Let me read the specific sections to see the exact context:


Now I can fix the specific `any` types with proper context:


```typescriptreact
      valueFormatter: (params: any) => {
        const image = params.value;
        return `<span class=\"text-gray-700 font-mono text-sm\">${image}</span>`;
      },

->

      valueFormatter: (params: ICellRendererParams) => {
        const image = params.value;
        return `<span class=\"text-gray-700 font-mono text-sm\">${image}</span>`;
      },
```

I need to use the correct type for valueFormatter. Let me check what imports are available and use the proper type:


I need to import the correct type for valueFormatter. Let me fix the import and use the proper type:


```typescriptreact
import { ColDef, GridOptions, GridReadyEvent, ModuleRegistry, AllCommunityModule, ICellRendererParams } from 'ag-grid-community';

->

import { ColDef, GridOptions, GridReadyEvent, ModuleRegistry, AllCommunityModule, ICellRendererParams, ValueFormatterParams } from 'ag-grid-community';
```

Now I need to use the correct type for valueFormatter:


```typescriptreact
      valueFormatter: (params: ICellRendererParams) => {
        const image = params.value;
        return `<span class=\"text-gray-700 font-mono text-sm\">${image}</span>`;
      },

->

      valueFormatter: (params: ValueFormatterParams) => {
        const image = params.value;
        return `<span class=\"text-gray-700 font-mono text-sm\">${image}</span>`;
      },
```

Now let me fix the other two valueFormatter instances:


```typescriptreact
      valueFormatter: (params: any) => {
        const ip = params.value;
        return ip ? `<span class=\"text-gray-700 font-mono text-sm\">${ip}</span>` : '-';
      },

->

      valueFormatter: (params: ValueFormatterParams) => {
        const ip = params.value;
        return ip ? `<span class=\"text-gray-700 font-mono text-sm\">${ip}</span>` : '-';
      },
```

```typescriptreact
      valueFormatter: (params: any) => {
        const appName = params.value;
        return appName || '-';
      },

->

      valueFormatter: (params: ValueFormatterParams) => {
        const appName = params.value;
        return appName || '-';
      },
```

Now let's try building the Docker image again to see if all the TypeScript/ESLint errors are fixed:


I still have some unused imports and variables. Let me fix the remaining issues:


```typescriptreact
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import { FiHome, FiCloud } from 'react-icons/fi';

->

import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
```

```typescriptreact
interface SidebarItem {
  icon: React.ReactNode;
  label: string;
  href: string;
}

->


```

Now I need to fix the unused `error` variable in kubernetes.tsx. Let me check where it's used:


I can see that the `error` variable is actually used in the JSX at line 694. The issue is that the linter is complaining about line 97, but I need to check what's on that line. Let me look at the specific area:


I see the issue. The `error` variable on line 97 is in a catch block and it's not being used. Let me fix this:


```typescriptreact
  } catch (error) {
    return <span className="text-red-500 text-sm">Invalid date</span>;
  }

->

  } catch {
    return <span className="text-red-500 text-sm">Invalid date</span>;
  }
```

Now let's try building the Docker image again:


Let me check if the build completed successfully:


Excellent! The Docker build completed successfully. The image `dallas-debugger:latest` has been created with a size of 1.54GB.

Let me also verify that the container can run properly:


The port 3000 is already in use, but that's expected. Let me try with a different port to verify the container starts:


Great! The container started successfully. Let me check if it's running properly:


Perfect! The container is running and healthy. Let me clean up the test container:


## Summary

I have successfully fixed all the TypeScript/ESLint errors that were preventing the Docker build from completing. Here's what I fixed:

### Issues Fixed:

1. **`app/ui/src/pages/header.tsx`**:
   - Removed unused `isClient` variable and its setter

2. **`app/ui/src/pages/infrastructure.tsx`**:
   - Removed unused imports: `FiMenu`, `FiX`, `FiHome`, `FiCloud`
   - Removed unused `SidebarItem` interface
   - Removed unused `sidebarItems` array
   - Removed unused `sidebarOpen` and `setSidebarOpen` state variables

3. **`app/ui/src/pages/kubernetes.tsx`**:
   - Fixed unused `error` variable in catch block by removing the parameter
   - Replaced all `any` types with proper TypeScript types:
     - `saveTableState` parameter: `any` → `Record<string, unknown>`
     - `cellRenderer` parameter: `any` → `ICellRendererParams`
     - `valueFormatter` parameters: `any` → `ValueFormatterParams`
   - Added proper import for `ValueFormatterParams` from ag-grid-community

### Result:

✅ **Docker build now completes successfully**
✅ **Container runs properly and is healthy**
✅ **All TypeScript/ESLint errors resolved**
✅ **Image size: 1.54GB**

The application is now ready for deployment and all linting issues have been resolved. The Docker image builds successfully and the container starts up properly with both the frontend and backend services running.

**User**

add the eslint check to precommit for any

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you add ESLint checks to the pre-commit hooks to prevent any TypeScript/ESLint errors from being committed. Let me first check the current project structure to see if there's already a pre-commit setup.


Great! I can see there's already a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. Let me examine it to see the current configuration:


I can see there are already some Node.js linting hooks, but they're set to `stages: [manual]` which means they don't run automatically on commit. Let me check if there are any lint scripts defined in the UI package.json:


Perfect! I can see there's a `lint` script that runs `next lint`. Now I need to update the pre-commit configuration to enable ESLint checks on commit. Let me modify the pre-commit config to:

1. Enable the existing npm lint hook to run on commit (remove `stages: [manual]`)
2. Add a type-check hook that runs on commit
3. Make sure they run on the appropriate file types


```yaml
  # Node.js linting
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: npm-lint
        name: npm lint
        entry: bash -c 'cd app/ui && npm run lint'
        language: system
        files: ^app/ui/.*\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$
        pass_filenames: false
        stages: [manual]

      - id: npm-type-check
        name: npm type check
        entry: bash -c 'cd app/ui && npm run type-check'
        language: system
        files: ^app/ui/.*\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$
        pass_filenames: false
        stages: [manual]

->

  # Node.js linting
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: npm-lint
        name: npm lint
        entry: bash -c 'cd app/ui && npm run lint'
        language: system
        files: ^app/ui/.*\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$
        pass_filenames: false

      - id: npm-type-check
        name: npm type check
        entry: bash -c 'cd app/ui && npx tsc --noEmit'
        language: system
        files: ^app/ui/.*\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$
        pass_filenames: false
```

Now let me test the pre-commit hooks to make sure they work correctly:


Excellent! Both hooks are working correctly. Now let me test that they run automatically on commit by creating a test file and trying to commit it:


I need to add the pre-commit config file first. Let me do that:


Perfect! The pre-commit hooks are working correctly. The ESLint check failed because it detected the same issues we fixed earlier, but it seems like the changes weren't properly saved or there are still some issues. Let me check the current state of the files and clean up the test file:


Let me check if there are still any linting issues by running the lint command directly:


Great! The linting is now clean. Let me go back to the root directory and test the pre-commit hooks again:


Perfect! Now let me test the complete pre-commit workflow by creating a simple test and committing it:


It seems like the changes I made earlier weren't properly saved or there are still some issues. Let me check the current state of the files and fix any remaining issues:


Let me check the current state of the files to see what's happening:


I can see that the changes weren't properly applied. The file still has the old content. It seems like the search_replace operations didn't work as expected. Let me check the git status to see what's happening:


I see the issue. The changes I made to the TypeScript files are not staged, and there are some test files that were staged but then deleted. Let me clean this up and properly apply the fixes:


Now let me properly fix the TypeScript files. It seems like my previous search_replace operations didn't work correctly. Let me reapply the fixes:


```typescriptreact
// ... existing code ...
export default function Header({ children }: HeaderProps) {
  // Sidebar state - always start with false (expanded) to match server
  const [sidebarCollapsed, setSidebarCollapsed] = useState(false);
  const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);
  const [hasLoadedFromCookie, setHasLoadedFromCookie] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Load sidebar state from cookie after client-side hydration
    const savedState = Cookies.get('sidebarCollapsed');
    if (savedState === 'true') {
      setSidebarCollapsed(true);
    }
    setHasLoadedFromCookie(true);
    // Mark as initialized after a short delay to prevent initial animation
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setIsInitialized(true);
    }, 100);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);
// ... existing code ...
```

```typescriptreact
// ... existing code ...
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import createDOMPurify from 'dompurify';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import axios from 'axios';
import Header from './header';
// ... existing code ...
export default function Infrastructure() {
  const [selectedCommand, setSelectedCommand] = useState('');
  const [commandOutput, setCommandOutput] = useState('');
  const [host, setHost] = useState('');
  const [port, setPort] = useState('');
  const [portError, setPortError] = useState('');
  const [hostError, setHostError] = useState('');
  const [securityState, setSecurityState] = useState<SecurityState>({
    csrfToken: uuidv4(),
    lastRequestTime: Date.now(),
    requestCount: 0,
    blockedUntil: null,
  });
  const [commandHistory, setCommandHistory] = useState<CommandHistory[]>([]);
  const [isRateLimited, setIsRateLimited] = useState(false);
  const [httpMethod, setHttpMethod] = useState('GET');
  const [httpUrl, setHttpUrl] = useState('');
  const [httpHeaders, setHttpHeaders] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
  const [httpError, setHttpError] = useState<string | null>(null);
// ... existing code ...
```

```typescriptreact
// ... existing code ...
const TimestampRenderer = (props: ICellRendererParams) => {
  const timestamp = props.value;
  if (!timestamp) return <span className="text-gray-500">-</span>;

  try {
    const date = new Date(timestamp);
    const formattedDate = date.toLocaleString('en-US', {
      year: 'numeric',
      month: 'short',
      day: 'numeric',
      hour: '2-digit',
      minute: '2-digit',
      second: '2-digit',
      timeZoneName: 'short'
    });

    return (
      <span className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
        {formattedDate}
      </span>
    );
-  } catch (error) {
+  } catch {
    return <span className="text-red-500 text-sm">Invalid date</span>;
  }
};
// ... existing code ...
```

It appears the files are already in the correct state, but the changes are not staged.
To finalize, please run:

```sh
git add app/ui/src/pages/header.tsx app/ui/src/pages/infrastructure.tsx app/ui/src/pages/kubernetes.tsx
git commit
```

This will allow the pre-commit hooks to run on the correct, fixed files.
**Your pre-commit hooks are now set up to run ESLint (including `no-explicit-any`) and TypeScript checks on every commit!**

```shellscript
git add app/ui/src/pages/header.tsx app/ui/src/pages/infrastructure.tsx app/ui/src/pages/kubernetes.tsx
git commit
```

**User**

can you make sure the make docker-all and make dev share the same eslint config

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! To ensure `make docker-all` and `make dev` share the same ESLint config, we need to confirm that both commands ultimately use the same linting process and configuration.

### Steps:
1. **Check what each Makefile target does** (especially for linting).
2. **Check the ESLint config file location and contents**.
3. **Ensure both commands use the same npm/yarn script for linting** (which should use the same config).

Let’s start by checking the `Makefile` for both targets and then confirm the ESLint config usage.

Here’s how things currently work:

- **`make dev`** runs `npm run dev` in `app/ui`, which uses Next.js’s dev server and its built-in ESLint config (`app/ui/.eslintrc.json`).
- **`make docker-all`** builds the Docker image, and in the Dockerfile, the frontend build step (`npm run build`) also uses the same ESLint config (`app/ui/.eslintrc.json`), since the config is copied into the Docker build context.

**Both development and Docker builds use the same ESLint config: `app/ui/.eslintrc.json`.**

### How this is ensured:
- The Dockerfile copies `.eslintrc.json` into the image before running `npm run build`.
- The dev environment uses the same file directly from the repo.

### If you want to enforce linting in both:
- Make sure your `package.json` `lint` script uses the config (it does, via Next.js).
- If you want to force linting to run as part of the Docker build, you could add a `RUN npm run lint` step before `RUN npm run build` in the Dockerfile (optional, but not required for config sharing).

---

**Summary:**
✅ `make dev` and `make docker-all` both use the same ESLint config (`app/ui/.eslintrc.json`).
No further action is needed unless you want to enforce linting as a separate step in the Docker build (let me know if you want this!).

---

**Cursor**

This error is coming from Next.js’s Hot Module Replacement (HMR) system in development mode. The message:

```
[HMR] Invalid message: {"action":"isrManifest","data":{"/":true,"/kubernetes":true}}
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'components')
```

means that the HMR client is receiving a message about the ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) manifest, but the expected `components` property is missing or undefined.

### What does this mean?
- **This is a Next.js internal dev overlay bug.**
- It’s usually harmless and only affects the dev experience (not production).
- It can be triggered by:
  - Upgrading Next.js without restarting the dev server.
  - A mismatch between the dev server and the browser’s HMR client.
  - Corrupted `.next` build artifacts.

---

## How to Fix

1. **Stop the dev server completely.**
2. **Delete the `.next` directory:**
   ```sh
   rm -rf app/ui/.next
   ```
3. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```sh
   cd app/ui
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Hard-refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).

---

### If the error persists:
- Make sure your Next.js version is consistent (`npm ls next`).
- Try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling:
  ```sh
  rm -rf app/ui/node_modules
  cd app/ui
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

---

**Summary:**
This is a transient Next.js dev/HMR bug. Cleaning `.next` and restarting the dev server almost always resolves it.
If you want, I can run these commands for you—just let me know!

```plaintext
[HMR] Invalid message: {"action":"isrManifest","data":{"/":true,"/kubernetes":true}}
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'components')
```

```shellscript
   rm -rf app/ui/.next
```

```shellscript
   cd app/ui
   npm run dev
```

```shellscript
  rm -rf app/ui/node_modules
  cd app/ui
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
